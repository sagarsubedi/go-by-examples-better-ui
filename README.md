This is a NextJS application. It is inspired by the Go By Examples website and the repo. All I am doing is adding a bit better looking UI on top of the repo using the stack I like. <br> Thanks to the https://github.com/mmcgrana/gobyexample repo. <br>
I haven't added any new tutorials. This is purely a front-end re-write.
